# paint swatch DOM exercise

build a page that:

* has a form
* one text input
* one color input (type="color")

then do this: 

* hook the text input up to an event listener (change)
* hook the color input up to an event listener (which one? look up available options!)

In a separate div below:

* display the text value from the text input
* display the color in a rectangle, above the text

**bonus:**

add a button to the form that, when clicked, creates another two inputs and another div, so you can have multiple swatches on the page. You should be able to make as many as you want.

**double bonus:**

add a delete button next to each paint swatch to remove it and the associated inputs.
